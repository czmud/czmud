- Hi, Iâ€™m Caleb.

I love being active, spending time outdoors, and most especially trad rock climbing ( style of climbing that relies on the climber to place all their own protection ). When not spending time in the outdoors, I enjoy spending time with my family and local community.

My formal education is in chemical engineering (B.S. 2018  UIUC). After working in industry as a process control engineer (2019-2022), I began the journey of transitioning to software development. I enrolled in a software bootcamp through Coding Dojo and graduated (September 2022).

Now I am on the job search and in the meantime have been pouring my time into continued learning through a handful of shared and personal projects!
